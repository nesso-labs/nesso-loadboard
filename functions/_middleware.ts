/**
 * Whole-site auth gate.
 *
 * A root-level `_middleware.ts` runs ahead of static assets on every path, so
 * this covers the SPA shell, the JS/CSS bundle and the D1-backed API alike —
 * there is no route that reaches a client-side check first. (Keep it that
 * way: adding a `_routes.json` that excludes paths would punch a hole
 * straight through this.)
 *
 * Beyond "is this a valid, active session", every /api/* request is also
 * checked against a role policy here — one chokepoint, not a check
 * duplicated in every handler:
 *   - /api/admin/*        → admin only (account management, login registry)
 *   - /api/auth/me|password → any signed-in user (self-service)
 *   - everything else      → editor/viewer only; viewer is read-only (GET)
 *
 * Admins never reach the second bucket — they have no workspace, so there is
 * nothing there for them to read or write. The SPA shell itself (non-/api/
 * paths) is only gated on "signed in" — which screen renders for which role
 * is a client-side routing concern (see src/App.tsx), since Pages serves the
 * same bundle for every path in a client-routed app.
